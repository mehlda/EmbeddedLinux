I have completed all 7 items. 


My Etch-a-Sketch program uses the ncurses library. It can be compiled using
the supplied makefile assuming that ncurses and gcc have been installed
on the host computer/beaglebone. When the program is run, it will ask for
three user inputs. The first is the desired width of the drawable area. A
good value is 40. The minimum value is 2. The second request is for the 
desired height of the drawable area. A good value is 15. The minimum is 2.
The third request is for the desired trace character. This can be any 
standard or special character on the keyboard, such as '#' or 'X'. 
After the inputs are completed, the game will run. Use the arrow keys 
to move, and use 'q' to quit and the space bar to clear the 
etch-a-sketch screen. For details on how the code works, see the source
file and comments

Question 1:
The browser sends messages that elicit a response from the bone. One such message is 'i2cset' which is followed by the bone's response of executing the i2cset command in order to send data, the first of which is configuration data. The browser also sends a message called 'matrix' which causes the bone to perform an i2cdump for the given i2c bus and sends the results of the operation back to the browser. There are also various messages for connecting to and disconnecting from the server.

Question 2:
When an LED is clicked, it calls LEDclick(i,j) which sends an i2cset command to the bone taht will tell the bone what the matrix should be, and will attach a class to the LED that distinguishes it as 'on'

Question 3:
'background-color' is the entry in the .css file that determines the color of the LED

Question 4: 
I intend to use additional classes. Rather than having an 'on' state, I will implement a 'green', 'red', and 'both' state that will handle the coloring of the matrix. This will handle the browser display portion. For the actual matrix, I will check what LEDs are on, apply the appropriate state, and then make a decision about what piece of the array to manipulate. Then I will add an additional byte to the i2cset message that is normally sent to encapsulate the two bytes needed for both red and green color of each column
